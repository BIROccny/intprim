@mainpage IntPrim

This is the API and code documentation for the IntPrim Python library.
While Doxygen is an unusual choice for documenting Python code, it has been chosen to maintain consistency with intprim_framework_ros which utilizes both Python and C++.

While the classes have not yet been organized into a package, they can be individually browsed under the Classes tab.
